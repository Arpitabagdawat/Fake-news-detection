After all, anyone with any sense whatsoever will stay far, far away from working for this Administration at all, because of Trump s penchant for ruining the lives and careers of everyone around him via public humiliation. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that an  email prankster  from the United Kingdom managed to trick several White House officials into believing he was Jared Kushner.According to CNN, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert feel for the hoax. The email read: Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soir e towards the end of August. It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening. Bossert returned the email to the Kushner imposter, and even gave the person his own email address: Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can t refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is  (redacted).Here is an image of the exchange, via CNN:Now, this guy is in charge of advising the loons in the White House on how to keep us safe. Yet, he was too dumb to realize that this was a hoax, likely for kicks, as the rest of the world is laughing at the clown car that is the Trump Administration. Think about that, and be absolutely terrified.They also got freshly fired White House Communications Director Anthony  The Mooch  Scaramucci. From CNN: I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free,  wrote the fake Priebus,  but after reading your tweet today which stated how;  soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn t , has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that s even remotely classy, yet you believe that s the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I ll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don t expect a reply. None of these people should be anywhere near our government, and yet they are running the whole damn thing.

And you can buy a UNICORN for just five bucks, and all because Trump is the best person ever!Cohn took the podium to tell voters about all of this good news which has to be for real because Trump is going to MAGA so hard, you ll also be able to take your family on a vacation for $1,000. Are you getting goosebumps, too? If we allow a family to keep another $1,000, they can renovate their kitchen, they can buy a new car, they can take a family vacation,  Cohn said.Maybe Cohn meant you can take your family on a vacay in your basement for $1,000. As for the brand new car and the renovated kitchen, I got nothin .Watch:That time when Gary Cohn who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars says a kitchen renovation costs $1K.

People just like Gary Cohn. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the top 1 percent of Americans would get half of the tax cuts under Trump s plan. By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close. Missed it by that much! The average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $21,797. According to American Express, the average vacation expense per person in the United States is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four.Image via screen capture. \",\n          \"Donald Trump took his angry little fingers to his Twitter account Thursday morning, threatening to abandon recovery efforts in Puerto Rico where the majority of the hurricane-devastated island s residents remain without power, water and food.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello immediately responded on Thursday to President Trump s warning, saying that the U.S. territory s residents are only asking for the same assistance that other Americans would receive. You know, like in Texas and Florida, two states which helped bring Trump to power. And yet, Trump did not issue threats to those states. The U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are requesting the support that any of our fellow citizens would receive across our Nation,  Rossello tweeted.The U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are requesting the support that any of our fellow citizens would receive across our Nation.  Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 12, 2017Some Puerto Rican officials, like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz, have pleaded for help, but in return, she received a backlash of hate from the amateur president who called her  nasty. Cruz shamed Trump on Twitter Thursday.  It is not that you do not get it; you are incapable of fulfilling the moral imperative to help the people of PR,  she tweeted.  Shame on you! @POTUS It is not that you do not get it; you are incapable of fulfilling the moral imperative to help the people of PR. Shame on you.!

Trump added:  These are great people. We want them to be safe and sound and secure. And we will be there every day until that happens. Two weeks later, Trump threatens to pull recovery efforts from the island while shaming the island for its debt   even though he filed for bankruptcy six times.Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 157,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"August 19, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Page, an oil industry consultant with numerous contacts in Russia, told Reuters in a text message that he delivered the documents to the Senate and House intelligence committees. \\u201cJust dropped irrelevant and unnecessary documents off for the Witch Hunt,\\u201d Page said in his text. \\u201cOn to bigger and better things now.\\u201d Page delivered the documents two weeks after acknowledging in an appearance before the House panel that he had not provided all relevant documents sought by a subpoena, including emails in which he and another former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, were included. According to a transcript of his testimony released last week, Page said that he had not turned over the emails because he assumed that the committee \\u201cmost likely would have received them from others already.\\u201d He agreed to submit them. Under subsequent questioning, Page first cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as a reason for withholding documents relevant to the committee subpoena. He then said that, \\u201cNothing would directly incriminate me,\\u201d but added that he was concerned about discrepancies between documents he withheld and materials collected by a government eavesdropping operation under a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant.  Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last month to a charge of lying to the FBI about his efforts to arrange a meeting during the 2016 campaign between then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Papadopolous also agreed to cooperate with the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Russia denies interfering in the 2016 campaign. Trump denies there was any collusion between his campaign and what U.S. intelligence agencies charge was a Russian influence operation that was intended to sway the vote to Trump over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The solidly Republican South suddenly looks a little less solid. Tuesday\\u2019s upset win by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama, coupled with last month\\u2019s Democratic sweep in Virginia, has given the party new optimism about its 2018 prospects in the South and other conservative, heavily rural regions where Republicans have dominated for decades. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, took advantage of the controversy over sexual misconduct allegations against his Republican opponent Roy Moore to become the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in Alabama in a quarter-century. The Jones campaign also offered a template for how Democrats can win in the South, strategists said: Field a strong candidate, crank up turnout among the region\\u2019s sizable bloc of African-American voters, keep the liberal national party brand at arm\\u2019s length and compete hard in every county and region. Add in the grass-roots energy of the liberal resistance to President Donald Trump, the disaffection of moderate suburbanites turned off by Trump and a conservative wing sapped of enthusiasm by Republican infighting, and Democrats see an opportunity for a brighter future in the South starting in next year\\u2019s midterm elections. \\u201cYou can hear that Republican wall in the South cracking. Doug Jones and Virginia are just the beginning,\\u201d said Phil Noble, a Democratic business and technology consultant who is running for governor in South Carolina. Republicans are not convinced, citing years of still unrealized Democratic predictions that demographic changes would turn Republican-dominated conservative states like Georgia and Texas into toss-ups. \\u201cDemocrats still have issues with their brand in large swaths of the country. They are the party of Nancy Pelosi, and that image is cemented in many voters\\u2019 minds,\\u201d said Brian Walsh, a former strategist for the Republican party\\u2019s Senate campaign committee, referring to the House of Representatives Democratic leader, a liberal from San Francisco. In the fight for control of Congress next year, wins on once hostile Southern turf could be crucial to the Democratic cause.  In the Senate, where Republicans\\u2019 already narrow majority will be shaved to 51-49 once Jones is seated, Democrats will have to defend 26 seats, including 10 in states won by Trump. They would need to pick up two more Republican-held states to reclaim control. Nevada and Arizona had been viewed as the only Republican-held seats vulnerable to a takeover next year. But Democrats now see possibilities in Tennessee, where popular former Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen has jumped into the race for the seat of retiring Republican Bob Corker, and Mississippi, where incumbent Republican Roger Wicker could face a bruising primary challenge. In the House of Representatives, Democrats need to gain 24 seats to win a majority. Their target list of 91 districts includes one each in Alabama, Arkansas and Kentucky, two in Georgia and four in North Carolina. \\u201cIf the election were held today, I do think you could see Democrats winning in some areas of the country where Democrats haven\\u2019t won in the last decade,\\u201d said Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster based in Alabama. In addition to the congressional races, governors\\u2019 contests in Georgia and South Carolina and state legislative races across the region will give Democrats a shot to compete in areas where they once dominated local politics but are now a minority party defined by liberal views on cultural issues such as abortion and gay rights. McCrary said Jones and Democrat John Bel Edwards, who won the Louisiana governor\\u2019s office in 2015, have shown it is possible to build a winning coalition in the South by energizing  African-American voters while also appealing to white swing voters, soft Republicans and independents. In Alabama, Jones made inroads with voters in Shelby County, the Republican suburbs of the state\\u2019s biggest city, Birmingham, outpolling the results of Hillary Clinton there in last year\\u2019s presidential election by about 20 percentage points. That should be a warning sign to Republicans after Trump\\u2019s weak performance in wealthier, more educated suburban districts in 2016 and Democrat Jon Ossoff\\u2019s strong, though ultimately losing bid in a special election earlier this year for a congressional seat in a suburban Atlanta district that has been long held by Republicans, said David Hughes, a professor at Auburn University-Montgomery in Alabama. \\u201cIf Democrats want to get out of the ditch they are in in Alabama and the South, they will do it in the suburbs,\\u201d said Hughes, an expert on Southern politics and judicial elections. In the nine states that form the political backbone of the Republican-dominated South - Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South and North Carolina - Republicans will hold 17 of the 18 Senate seats once Jones takes office as well as 56 of the 70 House seats. Democratic Party Chairman Tom Perez acknowledged on Wednesday that the national party kept a low profile in Alabama even as it pumped money into turnout efforts targeting blacks and young voters because it knew that publicity about its involvement would not help Jones. But Perez said the victory showed that the party, which has launched a 50-state organizing effort aimed at electing candidates at the local and state levels, can compete in the South and elsewhere. \\u201cWe can win in every zip code in America,\\u201d Perez told reporters. Democrats in Alabama said the party can start by learning lessons from Jones, who campaigned in every corner of the state and portrayed himself as a bridge builder who would listen to voters\\u2019 concerns and work across the aisle to help Alabama. \\u201cThis is what we need to be doing more of, and not just at election time,\\u201d Thomas Jackson, a black Alabama state representative, said at a fish fry attended by Jones in rural Alabama last month. \\u201cWe can get a lot accomplished if we just sit down and talk with people more.\\u201d \",\n          \" (Corrects spelling of Virginia House of Delegates member David Yancey throughout in this Dec. 19 story.) By Sharon Bernstein (Reuters) - Virginia Democrat Shelly Simonds won a seat in the House of Delegates by one vote, changing the power balance in the state legislature and extending a tide of Democratic victories beginning with November\\u2019s capture of the governorship and several legislative seats. Simonds beat incumbent David Yancey in a recount held Tuesday, both parties said in statements released after the unofficial vote recount was completed by officials in Newport News. \\u201cNever, ever forget how very much your vote counts,\\u201d House of Delegates member David Toscano said on Twitter, one of many Democrats rejoicing that a single vote handed them the seat. \\u201cI want to thank the voters who came out on Nov. 7,\\u201d Simonds said in a news release. \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t have happened without their participation.\\u201d Republican leaders in the House of Delegates welcomed Simonds and thanked Yancey for his service, but the chairman of the state party vowed to fight on. \\u201cToday, our opponents carried the day,\\u201d Republican Party of Virginia Chairman John Whitbeck said in a statement emailed to Reuters. \\u201cTomorrow, we begin again.\\u201d Simonds\\u2019 election, which still must be affirmed by a panel of three judges, means that the 100-member House of Delegates will have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.  That could lead to more moderate policies by forcing the parties to share power. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Republicans held 66 seats to Democrats\\u2019 34, along with a majority in the state senate, according to the election information website Ballotpedia. The GOP still holds a slim margin in the senate. Also on Nov. 7, the state elected Democrat Ralph Northam in a bitter race for governor, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump with a decisive victory over a Republican who had adopted some of the president\\u2019s combative tactics and issues. Democrats also picked up a hotly contested Senate seat in Alabama this month, after Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated Republican Roy Moore in a special election to replace former Senator Jeff Sessions, now President Trump\\u2019s Attorney General. Democratic Party activists hope their candidates can ride to victories in the 2018 Congressional elections on a wave of voter disenchantment with Trump and his Republicans.  Four legislative races, including the Simonds-Yancey battle in the 94th District, were slated for recounts. Going into the 94th District recount, Yancey was ahead by just 10 votes. On Tuesday, that changed, and Simonds clinched with a margin of one. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 31, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill. But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a ridiculous position,\\u201d McConnell told ABC. Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill. In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,\\u201d McConnell said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a very untenable position.\\u201d Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject. McConnell said he was also optimistic that House and Senate Republicans could agree on unified tax legislation to send to President Donald Trump after the Senate approved its own bill on Saturday. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, who won a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat this week, on Thursday called on his Republican opponent to concede the race and help heal the Southern state after a deeply divisive contest. Roy Moore, the conservative Christian Republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, made a second statement on Wednesday night in which he did not concede the election. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, will be the first Democrat to hold a Senate seat in Alabama in a quarter-century, narrowing Republicans\\u2019 majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats and potentially making it more difficult for them to pursue President Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda. With 99 percent of the vote counted, Jones had a lead of 1.5 percentage points over Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court Justice. Alabama\\u2019s secretary of state, a Republican, has said the remaining ballots from Tuesday\\u2019s election were unlikely to shrink the victory to the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount. Jones said in an interview with NBC that he was confident of the outcome. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to move on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe people of Alabama have now spoken ... Let\\u2019s get this behind us so the people of Alabama can get someone in there and start working for them.\\u201d Asked whether Moore should concede, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised. It sounds like it ... should have already taken place.\\u201d Jones on Wednesday said he had received congratulatory phone calls from Trump, who had endorsed Moore, as well as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\u201cThe president\\u2019s already called and congratulated Doug Jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and meet with him when he arrives,\\u201d Sanders said. \",\n          \"Fox  News  host Sean Hannity spent a whopping 6 seconds covering Tuesday night s election results in which Democrats gained seats across the country in a referendum to Donald Trump and his policies. Hannity, an ardent defender of Trump s, explained the Democratic electoral victories in three of the states by saying,  Those results in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York   not states Donald Trump won.  Hannity devoted 14 words to cover the election results in which Democrats trounced Republicans. In fact, as Shareblue notes,  Democrats flipped 14 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates   the largest Democratic gain in a single election in the state since 1899.

Instead of covering the big news, Hannity, a man who can be spotted usually humping on Trump s leg, decided to cover the former reality show star s speech in South Korea and his 2016  victory.

Jason (@berg0887) November 8, 2017That s some real in-depth reporting there, Sean. The Fox News host likes to routinely call liberals  snowflakes  but he s the snowflakiest snowflake on TV.  It s probably better for Hannity that he didn t report the actual news, though. It looks like he was about to cry.

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill. But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a ridiculous position,\\u201d McConnell told ABC. Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill. In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,\\u201d McConnell said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a very untenable position.\\u201d Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject. McConnell said he was also optimistic that House and Senate Republicans could agree on unified tax legislation to send to President Donald Trump after the Senate approved its own bill on Saturday. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, who won a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat this week, on Thursday called on his Republican opponent to concede the race and help heal the Southern state after a deeply divisive contest. Roy Moore, the conservative Christian Republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, made a second statement on Wednesday night in which he did not concede the election. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, will be the first Democrat to hold a Senate seat in Alabama in a quarter-century, narrowing Republicans\\u2019 majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats and potentially making it more difficult for them to pursue President Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda. With 99 percent of the vote counted, Jones had a lead of 1.5 percentage points over Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court Justice. Alabama\\u2019s secretary of state, a Republican, has said the remaining ballots from Tuesday\\u2019s election were unlikely to shrink the victory to the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount. Jones said in an interview with NBC that he was confident of the outcome. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to move on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe people of Alabama have now spoken ... Let\\u2019s get this behind us so the people of Alabama can get someone in there and start working for them.\\u201d Asked whether Moore should concede, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised. It sounds like it ... should have already taken place.\\u201d Jones on Wednesday said he had received congratulatory phone calls from Trump, who had endorsed Moore, as well as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\u201cThe president\\u2019s already called and congratulated Doug Jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and meet with him when he arrives,\\u201d Sanders said. \",\n          \"Fox  News  host Sean Hannity spent a whopping 6 seconds covering Tuesday night s election results in which Democrats gained seats across the country in a referendum to Donald Trump and his policies. Hannity, an ardent defender of Trump s, explained the Democratic electoral victories in three of the states by saying,  Those results in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York   not states Donald Trump won.  Hannity devoted 14 words to cover the election results in which Democrats trounced Republicans. In fact, as Shareblue notes,  Democrats flipped 14 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates   the largest Democratic gain in a single election in the state since 1899.

Instead of covering the big news, Hannity, a man who can be spotted usually humping on Trump s leg, decided to cover the former reality show star s speech in South Korea and his 2016  victory.

Jason (@berg0887) November 8, 2017That s some real in-depth reporting there, Sean. The Fox News host likes to routinely call liberals  snowflakes  but he s the snowflakiest snowflake on TV.  It s probably better for Hannity that he didn t report the actual news, though. It looks like he was about to cry.

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill. But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a ridiculous position,\\u201d McConnell told ABC. Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill. In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,\\u201d McConnell said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a very untenable position.\\u201d Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject. McConnell said he was also optimistic that House and Senate Republicans could agree on unified tax legislation to send to President Donald Trump after the Senate approved its own bill on Saturday. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, who won a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat this week, on Thursday called on his Republican opponent to concede the race and help heal the Southern state after a deeply divisive contest. Roy Moore, the conservative Christian Republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, made a second statement on Wednesday night in which he did not concede the election. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, will be the first Democrat to hold a Senate seat in Alabama in a quarter-century, narrowing Republicans\\u2019 majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats and potentially making it more difficult for them to pursue President Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda. With 99 percent of the vote counted, Jones had a lead of 1.5 percentage points over Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court Justice. Alabama\\u2019s secretary of state, a Republican, has said the remaining ballots from Tuesday\\u2019s election were unlikely to shrink the victory to the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount. Jones said in an interview with NBC that he was confident of the outcome. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to move on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe people of Alabama have now spoken ... Let\\u2019s get this behind us so the people of Alabama can get someone in there and start working for them.\\u201d Asked whether Moore should concede, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised. It sounds like it ... should have already taken place.\\u201d Jones on Wednesday said he had received congratulatory phone calls from Trump, who had endorsed Moore, as well as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\u201cThe president\\u2019s already called and congratulated Doug Jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and meet with him when he arrives,\\u201d Sanders said. \",\n          \"Fox  News  host Sean Hannity spent a whopping 6 seconds covering Tuesday night s election results in which Democrats gained seats across the country in a referendum to Donald Trump and his policies. Hannity, an ardent defender of Trump s, explained the Democratic electoral victories in three of the states by saying,  Those results in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York   not states Donald Trump won.  Hannity devoted 14 words to cover the election results in which Democrats trounced Republicans. In fact, as Shareblue notes,  Democrats flipped 14 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates   the largest Democratic gain in a single election in the state since 1899. Hannity just shrugged it off.Watch:Sean Hannity's election coverage pic.twitter.com/l8DNJbfVRq  John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) November 8, 2017After the hate-march in Charlottesville, Virginia in which tiki-torch carrying bigots terrorized the city while marching in Trump s name, resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, the Commonwealth rejected hate and bigotry at the polls yesterday.Newly elected Virginia state delegate Danica Roem, an openly transgender woman, defeated Bob Marshall, a Republican incumbent who billed himself as the commonwealth s  chief homophobe. Instead of covering the big news, Hannity, a man who can be spotted usually humping on Trump s leg, decided to cover the former reality show star s speech in South Korea and his 2016  victory. Tonight on #Hannity we will cover President Trump s speech in South Korea and election results with @SebGorka, @AmbJohnBolton, @peterschweizer, @MonicaCrowley, @GreggJarrett and more  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 8, 2017And Trump is the reason Republicans lost so many seats last night, but Hannity wants to sing his praises and ignore the massive beating the GOP took.The Internet decided to rub it in his face.What's your take on the election results, Sean?

Jason (@berg0887) November 8, 2017That s some real in-depth reporting there, Sean. The Fox News host likes to routinely call liberals  snowflakes  but he s the snowflakiest snowflake on TV.  It s probably better for Hannity that he didn t report the actual news, though. It looks like he was about to cry. Although, drinking Hannity s salty conservative tears is kind of satisfying after Trump stumped so hard for Ed Gillespie s campaign on Twitter.Image via screen capture. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 217,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"November 25, 2017 \",\n          \"December 27, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

With funding for the federal government due to run out on Friday, Republican leaders need to put together the votes for a spending bill. But Democrats have said they will insist on protections for Dreamers as the price of their support for a spending bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a ridiculous position,\\u201d McConnell told ABC. Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, at least some Democratic votes will be needed to pass the spending bill. In September, Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which shields young illegal immigrants from deportation. He gave Congress six months to find a solution. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a non-emergency that we can address anytime between now and March,\\u201d McConnell said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a very untenable position.\\u201d Trump and Republican leaders want measures strengthening border enforcement to accompany any relief for the Dreamers, a stance Democrats reject. McConnell said he was also optimistic that House and Senate Republicans could agree on unified tax legislation to send to President Donald Trump after the Senate approved its own bill on Saturday. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, who won a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat this week, on Thursday called on his Republican opponent to concede the race and help heal the Southern state after a deeply divisive contest. Roy Moore, the conservative Christian Republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, made a second statement on Wednesday night in which he did not concede the election. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, will be the first Democrat to hold a Senate seat in Alabama in a quarter-century, narrowing Republicans\\u2019 majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats and potentially making it more difficult for them to pursue President Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda. With 99 percent of the vote counted, Jones had a lead of 1.5 percentage points over Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court Justice. Alabama\\u2019s secretary of state, a Republican, has said the remaining ballots from Tuesday\\u2019s election were unlikely to shrink the victory to the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount. Jones said in an interview with NBC that he was confident of the outcome. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time to move on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe people of Alabama have now spoken ... Let\\u2019s get this behind us so the people of Alabama can get someone in there and start working for them.\\u201d Asked whether Moore should concede, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, \\u201cI\\u2019m surprised. It sounds like it ... should have already taken place.\\u201d Jones on Wednesday said he had received congratulatory phone calls from Trump, who had endorsed Moore, as well as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\u201cThe president\\u2019s already called and congratulated Doug Jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and meet with him when he arrives,\\u201d Sanders said. \",\n          \"Fox  News  host Sean Hannity spent a whopping 6 seconds covering Tuesday night s election results in which Democrats gained seats across the country in a referendum to Donald Trump and his policies.

It s probably better for Hannity that he didn t report the actual news, though. It looks like he was about to cry.
